Within one year, I went from a childless, carefree, craft beer drinking dude to a multiple autoimmune disease, worrying father seeking major life changes. If there is one thing I’ve learned so far, it is it all starts with encouraging open, respectful dialogue and choosing empathy over judgment. My family and I are redefining our new normal one day-at-a-time. All of us with autoimmune diseases know it isn’t easy, but it will be worth it.
