To fully understand my daily struggle, I encourage us to watch the AT&T “just okay” commercials and feign excitement if we all only felt “just okay.” My daily struggles overtook my life. They wrapped around me preventing me from completing the simplest of tasks. They broke relationships and slowly dug a hole for me to hide.

## Diagnosis

It took several years of ignoring my symptoms and avoiding annual checkups before I found out why I feel sluggish and empty every day. On December 4, 2018, I was diagnosed with my first autoimmune disease, Hashimoto’s. After three months of tests and denial on my end, the diagnosis came. I had a TSH of 17 u(iU)/mL and TPO Ab antibodies of 488 (IU)/mL (Optimal range: TSH 0-2 and TPO Ab <4).

As someone who had never heard of Hashimoto’s Disease or hypothyroidism, I initially felt a mixture of relief and fear. I felt relief with knowing why I experienced symptoms such as joint pain, fatigue, hair loss, and brain fog, but felt fear for my health and, more importantly, how it would affect me as a father with our first baby due in July 2019. I researched Hashimoto’s Disease religiously finding many contradicting treatments and drastic life changes leaving me with more questions than my foggy mind could handle. After a few deep breaths, I knew I had no choice but to accept the new me and take action.

There is a future for people with autoimmune diseases. It is not a death sentence. It is a reality check reminding us to take care of our bodies. It is a reminder to listen to our bodies and how our choices affect them.

## Words of advice

1.	Keep breathing – We can improve our health. Making sure we take time to breathe and remind ourselves we are strong will help smooth the road for our journey.
2.	Seek a support system – Find a support system as we start our health journey. We can confide in local and online autoimmune disease groups consisting of others who are experiencing similar issues.
3.	Be honest – Be honest with us. Be honest with our close friends and family. Denial will only prolong the start of our journey. 
4.	Step-by-step – Take it one day at a time. We did not get an autoimmune disease overnight and we will not tame it in one day. “Every day in every way, I’m getting better and better.” Emile Coue
5.	Let go – Don’t be afraid to let go of our old self. Let go of the old hobbies and find new health-focused ones. I’m sure I’ll write a post on my struggle with letting go of my craft beer hobby. 
6.	Leave our comfort zone – Don’t be afraid to research and seek out non-conventional medicine options such as alternative and functional medicine. 
7.	Contribute everyday – Make every day count and celebrate our accomplishments no matter how small. Going on walk, ignoring our sugar cravings, reading a book to our children, or mowing the lawn can all give us a sense of accomplishment and relieve stress. 

Remember it’s our health, our bodies, our decision. We are all different and need personalized approaches to our health. No approach or diet is perfect for everyone. 

### Let’s make it happen.
